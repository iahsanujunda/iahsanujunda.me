Embedding image URL from google drive is actually easy. We just have to convert the URL we got from google drive from this format `https://drive.google.com/file/d/[image_id]/view?usp=sharing` to this format `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=[image_id]`.

Even easier, just use this tool I make: [gdrive-url-converter](https://gdrive-url-convert.herokuapp.com)

I build this tool using React as I have not got a chance to play with React for a long time. It is a good exercise to flex my front-end muscle.
